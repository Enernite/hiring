### Understanding the framework

> Our progression framework has been developed to help all software engineers know what's expected of them and what they need to do to further their careers at Enernite.

### Understanding the role requirements

The [roles](\path) sections shows the available progression paths. Look at these with your line manager as well as the role descriptions to get an understanding of what is required of each role that is of interest to you.

It is also worth studying the accompanying skills definitions for the roles you are interested in. Reading each skill individually will give you a good understanding of the scale of individual skills.

### Making a plan for progression

The [progression overview](\path) explains the process and how to prepare for advancing your role.

Remember to use the framework in catch ups with your line manager; record your achievements regularly, set your goals, ask for feedback often to assess your progress. Make a plan for progression early and get started on the road to gaining the experience and evidence you need to get promoted.

If you're lacking training then seek it out through the courses available in [Enernite Academy](\path). If nothing internal is available then you can help by finding external material and building a Bridge course for others in future - which will help advance your Community skill!

Good luck :blush:
