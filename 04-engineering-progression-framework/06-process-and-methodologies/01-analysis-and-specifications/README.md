### Analysis & Specification (iANA) ###

> Interpreting specifications and applying them practically to new and existing solutions. Analysing customer requirements and how to transcribe them into solution-specific output. Engaging with the right stakeholders and peers to produce relevant and meaningful system proposals.

LVL 2 - Engineer I
Is able to follow basic specification set by others, clarifying details with their team.

works to specifications already provided by other team members.
may require guidance on how to implement a specification within their domain.
regularly discusses their planned approach with a more senior team member.
understands Gherkin acceptance criteria, and can contribute to producing them as part of a group workshop.
LVL 3 - Engineer II
Regularly writes specification for basic features, working with more senior members for analysing and specifying more complex work.

is comfortable contributing to understanding the problem and coming up with a solution as part of a team or pairing.
is able to interpret specifications and implement a solution within their domain.
is able to write basic specifications but requires supervision/guidance for more complex features.
is able to support senior team members with code/system audits to identify issues and common problems and contribute to a report document as required.
can write standard Gherkin and is capable of producing multiple scenarios for any given feature to account for different cases as relevant.
LVL 4 - Senior I
Builds up requirements and proposes detailed specifications to new or existing clients. Considers and manages the impact of changes on other domains or areas of their application.

is comfortable analysing problems within a subdomain, building up requirements and turning them into a simple specification document, or part of a larger one, for submission as a formal pitch to clients.
considers the non-technical requirements and impact of a system, for example the manual effort required to perform the administration of the feature.
contributes answers to client RFP requirements using their technical and domain experience.
conducts technical investigations ("spikes") to identify and compare possible approaches for small problems, documenting the outcome.
LVL 5 - Senior II, TTL
Converts complex problems into client-facing specifications, and conducts audits of existing applications to recommend improvement. Delegates and supports other members to analyse and specify in their domains.

has the experience to break down large problems and compose them into client-facing specifications.
supervises others in creating specification documents, delegating responsibilities as necessary without needing to be directly involved in the analysis.
performs a complete audit of an existing application and/or system to identify issues and common problems, and produce a suitable report document for a client.
can produce Gherkin scenarios to cover the main acceptance criteria as well all reasonable variations and edge-cases. Understands when edge-cases are exceeding the bounds of obscurity.
conducts technical investigations ("spikes") to identify and compare possible approaches for highly complex problems, documenting the outcome.
LVL 6 - Principal, SEM
Supports pitches to new or existing clients and can communicate complex systems through documents and presentations. Works with others to transform high-level business requirements into technical recommendations.

produces pitch-level analysis of client requirements to architect a large-scale solution.
collaborates with other team members and the client to document business needs and assumptions to help inform the eventual specification.
considers multiple facets of a system, including those outside of their area of expertise in order to determine what other providers are required to produce and be responsible for.
can provide alternative solutions, communicating at a high level the implications and cost of each.
communicates their designs and visions through various means including documents, presentations and various types of diagrams at different levels of abstraction (system, data flow, component, etc).
